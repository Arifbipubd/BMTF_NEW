                including fabrication, erection, cutting, painting, etc. These sections ensure the 
                qualitative output of the product at every step. The long manufacturing lines are 
                fully mechanized and automated to ensure one-stop manufacturing, from the conversion 
                of raw material to the finished products. Through our manufacturing lines, we are capable 
                of meeting the quality standard certification and delivering products on time. Additionally, 
                our lines are directly linked to processing lines where the finished steel pipes and sheets 
                are shaped, dimensioned, and quality-checked based on our customersâ€™ requirements. The 
                automation of our processing lines has been optimized to achieve high-precision, high-speed 
                cutting, and smooth milling. Our shop is equipped with state-of-the-art machines like CNC 
                flame cutting machine, shearing machine, automatic submerged gantry welding machine, 
                straightening machines, radial drill machines, and various types of hydraulic machines.`,
