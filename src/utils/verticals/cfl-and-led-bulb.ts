                transition 20% of its total electricity and fuel sector to renewable energy 
                sources as part of its sustainable development goal for 2030. This initiative 
                has already achieved a total capacity of 220 MW of solar power through the installation 
                of 6.9 million solar home systems (SHSs). The National Solar Energy Roadmap for 2021-2041 
                has been successfully implemented, with solar lights being adopted by various government 
                and non-government organizations. Furthermore, the installation of new Solar Street Lights 
                in zillas and upazilas throughout the country is currently underway. In addition to the new 
                installations, 20% of the existing lights are being replaced by Solar Street Lights. Different 
                city corporations are actively involved in this project, and BMTF is a proud partner in this 
                journey.`,
